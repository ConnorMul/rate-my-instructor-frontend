# Rate my Instructor Fronend

Hello This is an app made my Jason Jordan and Connor Mulholland for our flatiron Rails Backend, JavaScript Frontend project. 

This app view reviews on their instructors, or give their feedback by giving a rating or making a comment. Users can edit /delete comments on the instructors or add a new instructor for review if he/she isn't in the system. 

App is modeled with a javascript frontend, ruby on rails backend, and postgreSQL database. App features one page with all custom CSS. 

## How to start on a Local Machine

Open Your back end in terminal and run "rails db:create", "rails db:migrate", "rails db:seed"
Then on the front end run a liveServer on the index.html file.
